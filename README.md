# snakesSocketBootstrap
The first version of snake, that can play online through socket.io and express. The fronted and the server has been held on netlify and heroku respectively.
<br>
It has only enough abilities for playing online. 
  + 1 player will create room, and send the room ID to your friend. And the game starts immediately.
  + The game ends when the snake bites itself or hits the wall. <br>
  + 
Some lacking functions: 
  + It does not have the ability to count time 3 2 1 Start.
  + Can't calculate score, the snake is just longer.
  + No time countdown.
  + Does not have the ability to stay at old room. And then asks your friend to play again but only instantly quit the game.
  <br>
  And has to repeat the old process to play again.
